# Marianette Miller-Meeks Postcard Campaign

## Why We’re Writing Postcards
We’re encouraging everyone to write postcards to Representative Marianette Miller-Meeks three times a month — on the 1st, 11th, and 21st — or whenever it fits your schedule.
Why? Because we believe Marianette must be held accountable. We’re asking her to stand up for Iowans and for Americans on the most crucial issues of our time. If she can’t — or won’t — find the courage to lead, then she should step aside so voters can elect someone with a spine.
Miller-Meeks won her seat by one of the narrowest margins in Iowa history. That means she can’t afford to ignore the voices of her constituents. This postcard campaign is a way to remind her: we’re watching, we care, and we vote.

## Please send your postcards to:
Marianette Miller-Meeks  
504 Cannon House Office Building  
Washington, DC 20515

You can also call her and leave a message at (202) 225-6576
